            <p>
                whether it is Google or Facebook, their only business is to serve you ads, collecting data about too
                but we will come another time. So lets stop them serving yor ads.

                <p>The first step to protect your data is to check the tracking activity by browsers. So lets start

                                        encrypted and is very difficult for outside people to spy on. Many websites

                                    choosing. You can download hosts files from the app but it is possible to use your
