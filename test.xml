      <title>FOSDEM 2020</title>
      <description>
        <p><a href="https://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a> is one of the largest gatherings of Free Software contributors in the world and happens each year in Brussels (Belgium) at the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/30358555#map=16/50.8199/4.3987">ULB Campus Solbosch</a>. In 2019, it was be held on Saturday, February 2nd, and Sunday, February 3rd.</p>
        <p>This was my 3rd year going to FOSDEM, with the two previous years participating and helping at the <a href="https://libreoffice.org">LibreOffice</a> and <a href="https://opensourcedesign.net/">Open Source Design</a> booths. This year though, I was part of the <a href="https://getfedora.org">Fedora Project</a> and OSD booth.</p>
        <p>I applied to help at the booth as a Fedora Ambassador and landed in Brussels a few days before the event.
This gave me some time to wander around the city and visit Brugge, which was a beautiful city.</p>

        <p>On Friday morning, Brian asked me to help him with the Fedora booth over at the <a href="https://wiki.centos.org/Events/Dojo/Brussels2019">CentOS Dojo event</a> at the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/244955992#map=19/50.84890/4.34909">Marriott Grand Place Hotel</a>. I arrived there at 9 AM and stayed during the whole day. There were some interesting talks over at the CentOS room and the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> one.</p>

        <p>As always, on Friday evening thereâ€™s the FOSDEM pre-party held at <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/3118693327">Delirium Taphouse Bar</a>, but this time I didnâ€™t go as thereâ€™s way too many people around.</p>
        <p>As always, FOSDEM started early morning on Saturday. It was snowing heavily but this didnâ€™t stop people from arriving.</p>
        <p><img src="../assets/img/posts/fosdem-snow.jpg" alt="Snow on Saturday" /></p>
        <p>We set-up the booth, with the Fedora roll-up banner, tablecloth, a <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedorator">Fedorator</a>, an old <a href="https://spins.fedoraproject.org/en/soas/">Sugar on a Stick</a> laptop and plenty of stickers and swag.</p>
        <p>Time goes by really fast when at the booths and the first day was already towards the end. Unfortunately, I still didnâ€™t manage to follow any talk (same as past years).</p>
        <p>The second day was a bit warmer and the sky was clear. We had 2-hour shifts for the booth but I couldnâ€™t stay much there because I was also helping at the OSD booth and had helped on Friday too.</p>
        <p>About the OSD booth, this year we had plenty more visitors come over at our booth and ask questions, also the devroom was full of people. Unlike past year, I missed the group photo because I was again running around the campus. No talk this second day either.</p>
        <p>All in all, FOSDEM was a nice event, I met old friends and new ones alike, but I canâ€™t talk much about the quality of the presentations, as I didnâ€™t manage to follow any.</p>
        <p>See you there next year! ðŸ˜Š</p>
